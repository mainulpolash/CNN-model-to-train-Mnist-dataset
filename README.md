# CNN-model-to-train-Mnist-dataset
I am going to implement a CNN model from scratch and train it with Mnist dataset.

** Dataset: Mnist dataset is a famous dataset for image classification where we need to classify hand-written digits (0-9) from image data. The data contain 60000 samples for train and 10000 samples for test. The images all have the same square size of 28Ã—28 pixels, and that the images are grayscale.

** Details of the functions that I use has been commented along with the code. 

** I have used jupyter notebook to write the codes. Be sure you have installed tensorflow before trying to run the code.
